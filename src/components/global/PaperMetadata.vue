            Radio access network (RAN) slicing is a key element in enabling current 5G\nnetworks and next-generation networks to meet the requirements of different\nservices in various verticals. However, the heterogeneous nature of these\nservices' requirements, along with the limited RAN resources, makes the RAN\nslicing very complex. Indeed, the challenge that mobile virtual network\noperators 
            (MVNOs) face is to rapidly adapt their RAN slicing strategies to the\nfrequent changes of the environment constraints and service requirements.\nMachine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), 
            are\nincreasingly considered a key enabler for automating the management and\norchestration of RAN slicing operations. Nerveless, the ability to generalize\nDRL models to multiple RAN slicing environments may be limited, due to their\nstrong dependence on the environment data on which they are trained. Federated\nlearning enables MVNOs to leverage more diverse training inputs for 
            DRL without\nthe high cost of collecting this data from different RANs. In this paper, we\npropose a federated deep reinforcement learning approach for RAN slicing. In\nthis approach, MVNOs collaborate to improve the performance of their DRL-based\nRAN slicing models. Each MVNO trains
             a DRL model and sends it for aggregation.\nThe aggregated model is then sent back to each MVNO for immediate use and\nfurther training.
             The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed\nDRL approach.
